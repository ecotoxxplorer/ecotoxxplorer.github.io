# Data Upload and Annotation

In a regular analysis session where a user is analyzing their own data, the first step would be to specify the organism, gene ID type, and the gene-level summarization, and to upload a properly formatted tab-delimited text file (.txt) containing the raw counts matrix. In this tutorial, we will use an example dataset accessible from the "Try our test data" button.
