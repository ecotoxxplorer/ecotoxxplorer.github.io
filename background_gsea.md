# Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)

Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (also functional enrichment analysis) is a method to identify classes of genes or proteins that are 
over-represented in a large set of genes or proteins, and may have an association with disease phenotypes. The method uses 
statistical approaches to identify significantly enriched or depleted groups of genes. Microarray and proteomics results 
often identify thousands of genes which are used for the analysis.
