# Heatmap Tool

Heatmap tool is another tool to examine patterns in the example Minnow (ethinylestradiol) uploaded expression dataset. For background details about heatmaps, please check [this page](background_hmap.md). 

The following figure shows a highlighted part of the heatmap and we can again see the significance of [Vtg7 gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=vtg7). When the dose (see the top header) refers to the treatment group as indicated by the red color, the [Vtg7 gene](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/?term=vtg7) is always down-regulated. The scale at the bottom of the page shows what the color palette indicate. At the right side of the panel, there is a tool to perform [GSEA](background_gsea.md) and examine enriched biological [pathways](background_pathway.md).
