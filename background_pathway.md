# Pathway

A pathway is generally a linked series of reactions between chemicals/genes occurring within a cell. It is a representation of our knowledge on the molecular interactions and links. The following figure provides a snapshot of Citrate cycle pathway from KEGG database where nodes with circle shape represent chemicals and the square ones, highlight genes. The coloring of the matched nodes relfect on the expression levels.
