# Enrichment Network Tool

EnrichNet is a web-service for enrichment analysis of gene and protein lists, exploiting information from molecular networks and providing a graph-based

nodes with same colors are clustered together (hierarchical clustering) based on the gene represented by each categoryh

For the "Link" option at the top left side, please choose "Overlap Ratio". Then, for the "Enrichment" option select GO Cellular Component and click on "Update" button. The following figure will be generated.

Another example of an erichment network is provided in the following snapshot. This network has a larger number of significant genes and hence, more connections between the enriched terms.
